- What's up everyone, I'm ThruVizion you might know me and you might not.
- I'm into gaming and spending time with my family. If you know me you know me from gaming (famous for not teching grabs and gettign hit by 6M)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python intro course. I actually love it. Get a little consumed in my thoughts, but if I can master just doing and cleaning up later I'll make enormous progress haha.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYTHING! I need practice and throwing myself in has always been my best learning exposure, but again I'm in my own head.
